# Higgs-Boson-Background-Event-Detection

The idea of this project was inspired from The Higgs boson machine learning challenge (HiggsML or Challenge in short).It had been set up to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists.The implementation shown here is part of the bigger challenge which was to find a (not necessarily connected) region in the feature space in
which there is a significant excess of events (called signal) compared to what known background processes can explain. Once the region has been fixed, a statistical (counting) test is applied to determine the significance of the excess. If the probability that the excess has been produced by background processes falls below a limit,the new particle is deemed to be discovered
